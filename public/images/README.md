## Image Cleanup Requirements

1. **Remove all placeholder testimonial images** - As testimonials are being deferred to future phases
2. **Remove virtual tour and feature illustrations** not aligned with current offerings
3. **Replace generic placeholder images** with authentic visuals of North Johannesburg

## Image Naming and Organisation

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `johannesburg-skyline.jpg`, `north-riding-property.jpg`)
- Organise images in appropriate directories:
  - `/backgrounds` - For hero and section background images
  - `/properties` - For property-related images
  - `/services` - For service-related imagery
  - `/charity` - For charity and Ubuntu Giving related images

## Technical Requirements

- All images should be optimised for web (compressed without quality loss)
- Hero images: Minimum 1920px width, JPG format
- Content images: Minimum 800px width, JPG format
- Icons and illustrations: SVG format where possible
- Maximum file size: 200KB for content images, 500KB for hero images

## Future Improvements

While the initial SVG images provide a good starting point, future phases should consider:
1. Replacing SVG backgrounds with authentic, high-quality photographs of Johannesburg
2. Adding actual property photos from Gary's portfolio
3. Creating more realistic and detailed icons using professional design services
